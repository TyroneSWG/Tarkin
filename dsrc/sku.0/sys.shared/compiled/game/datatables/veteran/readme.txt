!!!IMPORTANT!!!

The rewards must be ordered so that the earliest awards given are at the top of the table, and the rest follow in consecutive chronological order.

The time per milestone is defined in veteran.scriptlib, currently at 90 days.

If you add a new template to the rewards table, make sure you run the tools/buildObjectTemplateCrcStringTables.pl script, or the reward won't show up in the rewards ui.
