# configs
This repository contains default configuration files for the SWG Source VM. These configuration files are not intended to be used as is, but rather they are templates to be used by `swg-main/build_linux.sh` when building the config environment. That script will add things like IP Addresses and a cluster name to the config files before they're ready to be used.
